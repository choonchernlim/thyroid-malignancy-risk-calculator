        <h5><i class="mdi-av-web"></i> About the tool</h5>

        <p>This tool was developed following a Bayesian approach for calculation of post-test probabilities based on
            pre-test probabilities and likelihood ratios.
        </p>

            States. McGraw-Hill Education.)
        </p>

        <p>The user has the ability to enter a pre-test probability based on clinical experience or following the
            American Thyroid Association ultrasound (US) risk stratification.

            Consensus, and Controversies”. Chicago, IL. June 20, 2014. Oral presentation)
        </p>

        <p> The likelihood ratio was generated from a systematic review regarding the diagnostic accuracy of US-fine
            needle aspiration biopsy for the diagnosis of thyroid malignancy.
