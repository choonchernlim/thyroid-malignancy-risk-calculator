            <h5>About the tool</h5>

            <p>This tool was developed following a Bayesian approach for calculation of post-test probabilities based on
                pre-test probabilities and likelihood ratios. (REF)
            </p>

            <p>The user has the ability to enter a pre-test probability based on clinical experience or following the
                American Thyroid Association ultrasound (US) risk stratification. (REF)
            </p>

            <p>The likelihood ratio was generated from a systematic review regarding the diagnostic accuracy of US-fine
                needle aspiration biopsy for the diagnosis of thyroid malignancy.
                Currently under peer-review (abstract available upon request). (May/2015)
